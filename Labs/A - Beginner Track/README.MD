Welcome to the labs which will guide you through Azure Security Center (ASC). <br>
The labs are intended to make you familiar with the different blades and Security Center's features. <br><br>

### Exploring the Security Center Overview blade

)<br>
4. This shows you the number of subscriptions and the coverage type. *Note:* in this lab you will only have one subscription which should be under **Standard coverage** <br>
   This view will help you find subscriptions that are not covered by ASC to help identify "shadow IT" subscriptions <br>
5. Go back to the overview blade and note the **Policy compliance** tile
6. Policy compliance provides a quick view of your overall policy compliance, which is calculated based on Security Centerâ€™s best practices. It highlights subscriptions with the least compliant resources.
