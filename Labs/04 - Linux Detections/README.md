# 04 - Linux Detections
*The following lab is based on the* <a href="https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/Azure-Security-Center-0ac8a5ef" target="_blank">Linux Detections playbook</a> *written by Yuri Diogenes. This playbook provides a more comphrensive explanation and simulations than is covered in this lab*<br>

In this lab we will explore the new Linux detections in ASC by executing steps in the Linux VM(s) that you have deployed earlier. You will connect to your Linux VM(s) leveraging SSH. In case you don't have a SSH client installed, you can install the free edition of MobaXterm <a href="https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download.html" target="_blank">here</a>.<br>
