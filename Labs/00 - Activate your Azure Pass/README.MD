# Activate your Azure Pass before starting the labs
In order to successfully walk through the Azure Security Center (ASC) labs, you first need to activate your Azure Pass, using the promo code that you have been given.<br>

Please - and this is important - **DO NOT** use your corporate email account to activate your Azure pass. Using your corporate email account will conflict and create confusion going through the labs.

## Create an Outlook.com account
1. Open an incognito browser session and navigate to https://outlook.live.com/owa/
2. Create a new Outlook account with your username and password of choice (you can delete this account after using the labs)
3. Make sure you remember the username and password, since this will be your identity you use to activate the Azure Pass and to login to the Azure portal

You have received your Azure Pass promo code<br>
